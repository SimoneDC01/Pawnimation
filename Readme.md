# Pawnimation

Pawnimation is a cinematic visualization system that transforms chess matches into immersive 3D experiences.

Built in **Unreal Engine 5**, it loads games from **PGN files** and recreates them move by move, with animations, sound effects, and dynamic camera movements that make each turn feel like a scene from a movie.

Developed as part of a **Master’s Degree thesis in Computer Engineering**, the project explores how cinematic techniques and reinforcement learning can enhance the visualization of abstract games like chess.

## Main Features

- **Cinematic Replay:** Recreates complete chess matches with smooth animations and visual effects.  
- **AI Camera Control:** A Reinforcement Learning agent dynamically chooses camera positions to achieve aesthetic, film-like framing.  
- **Destruction Effects:** Captured pieces are replaced with physics-based geometry collections that shatter on impact.  
- **Stylized Environment:** The chessboard floats in a vast cosmic background, enhancing the epic and surreal tone of the match.  
- **Immersive Soundtrack:** Original sound design to match the intensity of the moves.

## Technical Highlights

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.5  
- **Implementation:** Blueprint  
- **Experimental component:** Reinforcement Learning agent (PPO-based) trained to find cinematic camera angles

## About the Project

This work was created as part of my Master’s Thesis:

> *"Pawnimation – Cinematic Chess Visualization in Unreal Engine 5 with Reinforcement Learning Camera Control"*

The goal was to explore how AI-driven cinematography can bring expressive storytelling into algorithmic visualization — blending logic, art, and technology.
